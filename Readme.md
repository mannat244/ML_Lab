## Machine Learning Laboratory

his repository contains implementations of various Machine Learning experiments performed as part of the Machine Learning Laboratory course. The experiments focus on understanding fundamental machine learning concepts such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning using standard datasets. Python and popular machine learning libraries are used to implement and analyze different algorithms. Each experiment is structured to emphasize correct methodology, reproducibility, and clear evaluation of results.
